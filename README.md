Rollify is a simple yet fun JavaScript-powered dice roll simulator. With a click of a button, the app generates a random number between 1 and 6, mimicking a real dice throw. The result is visually represented using dynamic dice face icons, making it perfect for games, quick decisions, or learning randomness in programming. Lightweight, interactive, and responsive â€” Rollify is a great showcase of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
